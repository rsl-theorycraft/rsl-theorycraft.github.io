Using champions like Valkyrie or Martyr with AoE team counter-attack combined with an Ally-Attack champion, it's possible to get the shield down on boss turn in order to deal incremental damage when the shield is down. 

This composition ***requires* Cardiel** with no exceptions. This is due to the need for block-debuffs in order to keep ahead of the boss while also needing to fill a AA role at the same time. This dual role is unique to this composition and is paired with either **Valkyrie** or **Martyr** who can provide team-wide counter-attack and survivability for the initial boss slam.

# Stats

Because you will take damage from Fyro's A3 slam, you will need special care when building your champs. His A3 does Max-HP based damage, so you are better off with **less HP** and **more defense**. The lower HP will limit the total damage, allowing your defense to mitigate the damage more effectively and keep it from breaking your shield and reducing your max HP.

As an example, a 6* awakened Coldheart with 30k HP and 3k DEF should be able to survive so long as she has a reasonable shield.

## Slot order

It's recommended to put your most important debuffer last in the turn order so they can place their debuffs at the end of Cardiel's team AA. If you can't kill the boss on T2, you will want to have **Heal Reduction**, for example. While if you can kill the boss, you may want to have **Decrease Defense** landed to help ensure you do enough damage.

## Valkyrie

If you are running Valkyrie, give her a solid 6k DEF if you can. This will give her a big enough shield to mitigate damage.

## Martyr
If you are running Martyr, she should have a shield set with at least 50k HP. Her **Increase Defense** buff will help make up for the smaller shield than you get from Valkyrie.

## Blessings

You will also need to consider the star level of your champions blessings as it will affect both their damage received but also their damage output. Lower blessing level = more defense + shield required to stay alive.

# Strategy

The strategy of this composition requires a little more careful tuning of abilities and cooldowns because it will likely require surviving several boss turns and getting the shield down each time to deal enough damage.

The basic strategy is as follows:

## First turn buffs (Boss Turn 1)

You want to have the following debuffs up on your entire team by the time the boss takes his first turn:

* **Block Debuffs** - Prevents your team from taking the **Dec. Speed** debuff and throwing off the speed tune. If you get this debuff, you will not be able to recover in time.
* **Shield** - Has to be big enough relative to your weakest champions EHP to survive the boss slam on T1.
* **Counter Attack** - Your entire team needs to CA in order to place enough hits on the shield to take it down and deal damage before the boss puts it back up each turn.

## AA + DPS (Boss Turn 2)

After the first boss turn, you should have the shield nearly down. Cardiel's AA from his A3 should take the shield down for you. From here, you want to deal as much damage as possible before the boss takes another turn.

## Turn 2 Kills

If you can, kill the boss on Turn 2. This likely requires Acrizia to deal enough damage, but it will ensure fast and reliable runs because it can be done without the need for debuffs and 3% resist rates.

## Turn 3+ Kills

If you can't kill the boss by end of Turn 2, you will want to make sure that you are preserving your shield as much as possible and able to get CA/AA abilities back up as soon as you can so they help you get the shield down on the next turn. For this, it's highly recommended to tune your specific team in the [Fire Knight Simulator](https://simulator.raidtoolkit.com/) to ensure each boss turn ends with the shield down and sufficient debuffs/buffs to ensure survival until you can kill him.
