Using champions like Valkyrie or Martyr with AoE team counter-attack combined with an Ally-Attack champion, it's possible to get the shield down on boss turn in order to deal incremental damage when the shield is down. 

This composition ***requires* Cardiel** with no exceptions. This is due to the need for block-debuffs in order to keep ahead of the boss while also needing to fill a AA role at the same time. This dual role is unique to this composition and is paired with either **Valkyrie** or **Martyr** who can provide team-wide counter-attack and survivability for the initial boss slam.
