Hard Fire Knight stage 10 is most likely the hardest content in the game right now due to the amount of different roles required to manage damage and shield mechanics. 

There's currently 2 general approaches to getting the shield down and dealing enough damage with the shield down to kill Fyro and survive the trip.

## Ally Attack + Counter Attack

This approach combines the elements of **ally attack** and **counter attack**, but also requires **block debuffs** (cleanser is not sufficient). Most notably, it requires **Cardiel** with no substitutions and is therefore not accessible to many players.

Using champions like Valkyrie or Martyr with AoE team counter-attack combined with an Ally-Attack champion, it's possible to get the shield down on boss turn in order to deal incremental damage when the shield is down. This composition ***requires* Cardiel** with no exceptions. This is due to the need for block-debuffs in order to keep ahead of the boss while also needing to fill a AA role at the same time. This dual role is unique to this composition and is paired with either Valkyrie or Martyr who can provide team-wide counter-attack and survivability for the initial boss slam.

## Double Ally-Attack

Double ally-attack compositions are more straightforward and have a slightly wider viable champion pool. It currently requires **Gnut** (July 23' Fusion), 2 **ally attack** champions, and a **cooldown reset with turn-meter boost**. Similarly to CA+AA, you're currently locked in on using **Kymar** in order to also fit sufficient **enemy max hp** based damage before the boss reclaims his shield.

These have a different set of specific champion requirements, and may prove to be an alternative to the more champion-locked counter-attack compositions.

* **Sufficient A1 hits** - Phantom Touch blessings help here
* ***Reliable* Freeze on A1**- currently the only viable champions for this role is Gnut
* Either:

  * **Second A1 freeze** with 6-8 Enemy Max HP hits in first boss turn (e.g. a second Gnut)
  * **Skill reset + TM boost** (Kymar)
