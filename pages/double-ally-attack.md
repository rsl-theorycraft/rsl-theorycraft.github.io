# Strategy

The following is the basic strategy of this composition without any modifications.

## Ally Attack #1 & #2 - Shield break + Freeze TM Reduction

The goal of this composition is to take the shield down AND place 3* freeze debuffs by the time your 2nd ally-attack finishes. This means if you have Gnut last in your team order, you need **23 total hits** including his which land after the shield is down (a freeze can be landed on the last hit of the shield that takes it down).  If you do it right, the FK turn meter will be at either **60%** or **77.5%** after your second AA:

## DPS phase 1

At this point, Gnut and your DPS will do their first damage to the boss. Ideally, you want to land a defense down here to greatly increase your next 2 damage passes and reliability of the team.

## Skill reset, TM boost

Kymar will use his A3 here and reset everyones cooldowns as well as boost the team to get another round of turns before FK can take his first turn.

## Ally Attack #3 & #4 - Freeze TM Reduction

Both AA champions will now need to use their skills to further reduce the FK turn meter via your A1 freeze champ (Gnut). This will reduce the turn meter just enough for both DPS to deliver one last round of damage. Boss turn meter should now be no higher than 92.5%

## DPS phase 2 (final)

Finally, you should plan to kill the FireKnight with your last two DPS turns. Depending on RNG and other modifications, you may get 1-2 more hits from your team before the end.
