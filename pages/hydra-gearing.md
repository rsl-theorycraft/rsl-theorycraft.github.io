# Gearing

Required speeds will be listed in their respective comps, but for all compositions you should consider these gearing requirements:

## Brogni

You will want Brogni to be in Savage and also Cruel sets if you can manage it. Maximize his damage as much as you can, as this will directly impact the shield increases he gives to Cadaver.

## Cadaver

{: .warning}
**DO NOT BOTHER WITH CRIT STATS.** Cadaver's A1 damage is not subject to crit damage multipliers, so you will not see any benefit from crit rate or crit damage.

Cadaver should either in a Divine set if an ally is not in a Shield set. 

You want Cadaver to keep as much of his shield as possible, so you will also want either Stalwart or 2 Defiant sets on him to mitigate damage to the shield. During the early fight, he will take hits from the Hydra heads and these will damage the shield and his damage potential. This makes a big difference.

Beyond sets, give Cadaver as much DEF and RES as possible. Since he should be in a shield for the entire run, his HP or EHP is not important.

*If you use the HH Optimizer, make sure to use the Balanced mode and not Survivability to make sure you can prioritize raw DEF instead of EHP*

Lastly, having the required ACC on cadaver to land provoke on Dickay is also nice to help control opening turns for harder rotations.

## Mischief Tank(*s*) (RES)

You will need 1 champion to be a designated Mischief tank. Mischief will target the champion with the most buffs to try and steal them. This will end a run very quickly if Cadaver has its shields stolen, or if a Yumeko has her turn meter reduced. This champion should be someone who brings an extra self-buff be built with high RES.

Regardless of your tank, you will also need enough resistance on both Yumekos as well, since they bring a veil buff of their own. 

When you kill Mischief, 2 random champions on your team will gain a veil buff- so eventually only your tank should be getting targeted; until then Yumeko will be vulnerable.

{: .important }
You may also want to give Cadaver enough resist as well, just to be safe. Depending on if anyone gets eaten by a hydra head, you may see Cadaver take a hit from Mischief. If he loses either of his shield buffs, the run is basically over in terms of reaching maximum damage

## Hex

Hex will substantially increase your damage, and also make Mischief manageable. Without it you'll have a pretty difficult time, so make sure you have a source of hex on your team:

* **Cursed Set** is your ideal choice on a champion who will be regularly using an AoE ability (Krisk, Lydia are good examples) and has a good chance to land it on Mischief.
* **Yumeko** brings hex on her A2, so giving her ACC makes this a good backup option for damage, but not great for dealing with Mischief since it is a single target ability.
* **Michinaki** also brings hex and strip buffs as well as Dec Defense, so he isn't a bad utility option.
