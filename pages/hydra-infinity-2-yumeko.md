| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **A dead corpse**                | [Corpulent Cadaver](https://hellhades.com/champions/corpulent-cadaver/) (no substitutions)  |
| **Broggers** | [Underpriest Brogni](https://hellhades.com/champions/underpriest-brogni/) (the one and only) |
| **Cooldown reset** (x2)  | [Yumeko](https://hellhades.com/champions/yumeko/) (must be able to extend eachother) |
| **Buff Extender** | **[Lanakis](https://hellhades.com/champions/lanakis/)** (preferred), [Krisk](https://hellhades.com/champions/krisk-the-ageless/), [Godseeker Aniri](https://hellhades.com/champions/godseeker-aniri/), [Taras](https://hellhades.com/champions/taras-the-fierce/), [Demytha](https://hellhades.com/champions/demytha/), [Duedan](https://hellhades.com/champions/duedan-the-runic/) |

## Considerations

Going into your team building, keep in mind the following additional considerations:

## Team Composition

This team has 4 locked roles of **Cadaver**, **Brogni**, and 2 **Yumeko**. After this, you can choose between options for your buff extender and utility slots.

### Buff extenders

[Lanakis](https://hellhades.com/champions/lanakis/) is most preferred for this composition because she brings more than anyone else to the team. She brings:

* **30% Crit Rate** buff, lowering gear requirements to pump more damage into Broggers.
* **Continual Healing** buff to make herself a Mischief tank. (70% CR ensures this happens early, but not required- it will happen eventually and then get perpetually extended)
* **30% TM boost**
* **Ally-Attack** mechanic can help with extra damage and more chances to RNG hits on Mischief with redirection.

[Krisk](https://hellhades.com/champions/krisk-the-ageless/) is another great option. 
* Provoke to manage Dickay early on
* Ally-Protection reduces damage taken by Cadaver *(maybe can skip Stalwart if you run Krisk?)*
* **AoE A2** (extender ability) is ideal for Cursed set

### Utility

In order to maximize your damage, you'll want to have someone bringing Def Down at a minimum- weaken also if possible. As mentioned in [Infinity Gearing](/hydra-gearing.html), you also want AoE Hex somewhere in the team, consider this when choosing your utility champ and their gear.

[Lydia](https://hellhades.com/champions/lydia-the-deathsiren/) is the preferred choice:
* **AoE A2** is ideal for Cursed set (will always use with Yume resets)
* **Strengthen buff** reduces damage taken by Cadaver
* **Increase Speed** because extra turns per boss turn is never a bad thing here.

[Uugo](https://hellhades.com/champions/uugo/) is another great option. While she doesn't have weaken in her kit, she does bring other utility:
* **AoE A2** is ideal for Cursed set (will always use with Yume resets)
* **Block Buffs** to help manage rotations with early Poison Cloud and things like Reflect Damage

[Michinaki](https://hellhades.com/champions/michinaki/) similar to Uugo doesn't have Weaken, but he does bring some extra benefits. The one downside is to most effectively use Michi, you will have to manual in order to cycle between his A2 and A3.
* **AoE Hex on A3** can reduce the need for a hex set (although due to 3% and affinity, one is still recommended!). It also strips buffs, which is nice
* **HP Burn A1** for some extra damage and early Poison Cloud management

## Speeds

| Role | Speed | Notes |
|:-----|:------|:------|
| Cadaver | 280 | Must be slower than extender |
| Brogni | 220-280 | Balance speed with damage |
| Yumeko | 305-335 | Both at similar speeds is recommended |
| Extender | 305-336+ | Fastest on team |
| Utility | 250-300 | Focus on req stats before speed |

## Skill setup

{: .important }
> The way the Yumekos cycle is similar to the way Maneaters do in easy double Maneater CB comp. The first Yume does A3 reset, the second does A2, then on next turn they swap so first Yume does A2 then the second does A3 reset. They should alternate like this until the rest of the fight.
> 
> If at any point they fall out of sync (as in you can reset back to back) then delay the reset on which ever Yumeko came 2nd in that boss turn and delay the A3 for 4 turns. Afterwards, auto as usual and the team is synced again. buffs should never fall in this team but buffs can be stolen so rebuffs need to happen, as well as Brogni getting eaten at the start. Rebuff Brogni ASAP after he is eaten.

| Role | Setup |
|:-----|:------|
| Cadaver | A1 only |
| Brogni | Open A3, then A2 only |
| Yumeko #1 | Prioritize A3 |
| Yumeko #2 | Prioritize A3, Open A2 |
| Extender | Buff Extension ability only |
| Utility | Depends, but generally focus their AoE/def down skill |


## Rotation starts

### Rotation 4 + 5

This is the **ideal startup** for maximizing damage. We recommend re-running the startup to get the right RNG for these rotations since it is hard to get early damage otherwise. 

{: .important }
If you are using Lanakis, modify the startup to use her A3 with extra turn, and target Blight with her A2. This gives Broggers a chance to join and land HP burn to allow a little more damage.

{: .important }
If you are using Lydia, modify the startup to use her A3 first on Dickay. This will prevent him from getting **Poison Cloud**, and thus allow you to keep provoking him and doing more damage while **Poison Cloud** ticks down on the other heads.

* **Extender** - extend buffs
* **Yume #1** - A3 (reset)
* **Yume #2** - A2
* **Utility** - Def down
* **Cadaver** - A3 target Dickay to provoke
* **Broggers** - A3 (unless running Krisk who brings a skill based shield, then A2)

At this point Poison Cloud will go up.  You will do Broggers damage to 1 head (or 2 if you landed HP Burn at start) until **Poison Cloud** clears. After this setup, follow the normal skill order defined in **AI Setup** above.
