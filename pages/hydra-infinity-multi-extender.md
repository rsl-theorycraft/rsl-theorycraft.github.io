| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |

| **Broggers** | [Underpriest Brogni](https://hellhades.com/champions/underpriest-brogni/) (the one and only) |
| **Buff Extender** (x3) | **[Lanakis](https://hellhades.com/champions/lanakis/)** (preferred), [Krisk](https://hellhades.com/champions/krisk-the-ageless/), [Godseeker Aniri](https://hellhades.com/champions/godseeker-aniri/), [Taras](https://hellhades.com/champions/taras-the-fierce/), [Demytha](https://hellhades.com/champions/demytha/), [Duedan](https://hellhades.com/champions/duedan-the-runic/) |
| **Utility** (AoE Def Down, Hex) | [Lydia](https://hellhades.com/champions/lydia-the-deathsiren/), [Uugo](https://hellhades.com/champions/Uugo/), [Michinaki](https://hellhades.com/champions/michinaki/)

## Considerations

Going into your team building, keep in mind the following additional considerations:

## Team Composition

This team has 2 locked roles of **Cadaver** and **Brogni**. After this, you can choose between options for your buff extenders and utility slot.

### Buff extenders

When running triple buff extenders, you should prefer champions with a 3 turn cooldown on their extension ability. This will help you keep 100% uptime on your buffs. You can run one extender with a 4 turn cooldown if you have to, but more than one of these will be extremely difficult at best.

[Krisk](https://hellhades.com/champions/krisk-the-ageless/) one of the most preferred options. He brings extra utility if you open with his A3 to get extra buffs and provoke Dickay.

* Provoke to manage Dickay early on
* Ally-Protection reduces damage taken by Cadaver *(maybe can skip Stalwart if you run Krisk?)*
* **AoE A2** (extender ability) is ideal for Cursed set

[Demytha](https://hellhades.com/champions/demytha/) is also a preferred option. She has:

* 3 turn cooldown
* **Healing and cleanse**
* **Block Damage** buff for the early setup to eliminate most damage that Cadaver would take to his shield. 

[Lanakis](https://hellhades.com/champions/lanakis/) is great for double-yumeko teams, but for this composition is a little harder due to her 4 turn cooldown. If you can fit her in, she does still bring a lot of utility:

* **30% Crit Rate** buff, lowering gear requirements to pump more damage into Broggers.
* **Continual Healing** buff to make herself a Mischief tank. (70% CR ensures this happens early, but not required- it will happen eventually and then get perpetually extended)
* **30% TM boost**
* **Ally-Attack** mechanic can help with extra damage and more chances to RNG hits on Mischief with redirection.

### Utility

In order to maximize your damage, you'll want to have someone bringing Def Down at a minimum- weaken also if possible. As mentioned in [Infinity Gearing](/hydra-gearing.html), you also want AoE Hex somewhere in the team, consider this when choosing your utility champ and their gear.

[Lydia](https://hellhades.com/champions/lydia-the-deathsiren/) is the preferred choice:
* **AoE A2** is ideal for Cursed set (will always use with Yume resets)
* **Strengthen buff** reduces damage taken by Cadaver
* **Increase Speed** because extra turns per boss turn is never a bad thing here.

[Uugo](https://hellhades.com/champions/uugo/) is another great option. While she doesn't have weaken in her kit, she does bring other utility:
* **AoE A2** is ideal for Cursed set (will always use with Yume resets)
* **Block Buffs** to help manage rotations with early Poison Cloud and things like Reflect Damage

[Michinaki](https://hellhades.com/champions/michinaki/) similar to Uugo doesn't have Weaken, but he does bring some extra benefits. The one downside is to most effectively use Michi, you will have to manual in order to cycle between his A2 and A3.
* **AoE Hex on A3** can reduce the need for a hex set (although due to 3% and affinity, one is still recommended!). It also strips buffs, which is nice
* **HP Burn A1** for some extra damage and early Poison Cloud management

## Speeds

| Role | Speed | Notes |
|:-----|:------|:------|
| Cadaver | 200-250 | Too fast and buffs will fall off |
| Brogni | 220-280 | Balance speed with damage |
| Extenders | 305-335 | If you have any 4cd extenders, make sure they have extra speed |
| Utility | 250-300 | Focus on req stats before speed |

## Skill setup

| Role | Setup |
|:-----|:------|
| Cadaver | A1 only |
| Brogni | Open A3, then A2 only |
| Extenders | Opener optional, prioritize Buff Extension ability |
| Utility | Depends, but generally focus their AoE/def down skill |

## Rotation starts

### Rotation 4 + 5

This is the **ideal startup** for maximizing damage. We recommend re-running the startup to get the right RNG for these rotations since it is hard to get early damage otherwise. 

{: .important }
If you are using Lanakis, modify the startup to use her A3 with extra turn, and target Blight with her A2. This gives Broggers a chance to join and land HP burn to allow a little more damage.

{: .important }
If you are using Lydia, modify the startup to use her A3 first on Dickay. This will prevent him from getting **Poison Cloud**, and thus allow you to keep provoking him and doing more damage while **Poison Cloud** ticks down on the other heads.

* **Extender #1** - extend buffs (*may optionally have different opener on 1 or 2 of them*)
* **Extender #2** - extend buffs
* **Extender #3** - extend buffs (notice a pattern?)
* **Utility** - Def down
* **Cadaver** - A3 target Dickay to provoke
* **Broggers** - A3 (unless running Krisk who brings a skill based shield, then A2)

At this point Poison Cloud will go up. Depending on if you had any block debuffs/HP burn and provoke on Dickay, you will be able to do some damage during this time. After waiting for **Poison Cloud** to clear, you should be able to proceed ramping shield/damage up.
